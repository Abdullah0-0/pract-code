        <h2>Learning CSS</h2>
        <p>
          Recently, I started learning HTML and CSS. I found HTML to be
          straightforward and relatively short, but not very exciting on its
          own. However, adding CSS to HTML made the learning process much more
          engaging and enjoyable. CSS allows for greater creativity, enabling me
          to style webpages, make them responsive, and add interactive elements,
          which brought my projects to life.

        <li>
          CSS plays an important role in creating accessible websites. With CSS,
          developers can provide alternative styles for users with visual
          impairments, such as larger font sizes and high-contrast color
          schemes.
